# Splinter

A learning agent with its own model. Tell it what to learn, in plain
language; it learns it, measures that it did, and releases a better version
of itself.

```
splinter "Learn all the facts about the STM32 reference manual from <path-to-manual>"
splinter "Learn what we can do with brain command line options"
splinter "Explain brain command line flags without interacting with brain"
```

Splinter is built on two standalone projects and replaces neither:

- **sven** runs the agent: tools, sessions, delegation, and a trustworthy
  record of what the agent did.
- **brain** runs the model: inference, training, evaluation and serving.

What Splinter releases is an ordinary brain adapter with a manifest. It runs
on plain `brain serve`, and plain sven can use it through its brain
provider; neither needs Splinter installed.

## Status

Early. Today's command line (`crates/splinter/README.md`) runs delegated
tasks through sven with a local in-process Qwen3, derives training data from
verified runs, extracts facts from documents, trains LoRA adapters through
brain and gates their promotion. The plain-language front door above is
being built on it.

## Building

sven and brain are git dependencies at the revisions pinned in `Cargo.lock`:

```bash
make build     # release build of every package
make test      # every test; no model, GPU or network needed
make check     # all gates: text hygiene, headers, fmt, clippy -D warnings, lock sources
```

To build against local checkouts instead - to change sven or brain and
Splinter together - write the gitignored local override once:

```bash
make local SVEN_DIR=<sven-checkout> BRAIN_DIR=<brain-checkout>
```

Builds then compile the checkouts' working trees, offline, without touching
`Cargo.toml` or `Cargo.lock`. `make lock` re-pins the lock to those
checkouts' HEADs; push those commits before sharing the lock. Delete
`.cargo/config.toml` to go back to the remotes.

Runtime state (runs, datasets, adapters) lives under `~/.splinter`
(override: `SPLINTER_STATE`).
