"""Pre-commit gate: every SPDX-relevant file has exactly one
"SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0" line, immediately followed by the
project's copyright line.

File selection (which extensions/basenames count, comment style, where the
header goes relative to a shebang/`#version`/etc.) lives in rules.py.

Usage:
    scripts/spdx/check.py <file> [<file> ...]     # validate (pre-commit passes these)
    scripts/spdx/check.py --fix <file> [<file> ...]  # also insert missing headers

Exit status: 0 if every relevant file is compliant, 1 otherwise (with every
violation printed, not just the first).
